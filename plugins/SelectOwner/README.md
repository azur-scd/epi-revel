omeka-plugin-SelectOwner
========================
Omeka plugin to assign an owner to an item or collection. When viewing an item or collection in the Omeka admin interface, the current owner of the item or collection will be displayed in the right-hand sidebar. When editing an item or collection, a dropdown list of users will be provided in the right-hand sidebar, so you may assign an owner to the item or collection.

A potential use for this plugin is to allow Admin or Super users to add new items and files to Omeka and assign ownership of those items to Contributors. The contributors will then be able to edit the metadata for those items, but not have access to other items they do not own.
